# Building a Website with Node.js and Express.js

Interested in building JavaScript websites that do more? Node.js and Express.js are a perfect match. Express is a fast, minimalist framework that sits on top of Node.js and allows you to build powerful single- and multi-page web applications and websites. Create a full-featured websites with these technologies. First, find out how to install each package and leverage Node.js features from within Express. Then learn how to build a basic application with templating engines like EJS; create more flexible, modular code with includes and conditional statements; build APIs to manage HTTP requests to add and delete content dynamically; and configure more complex routing. Along the way, Ray implements features like customer feedback forms and real-time live chat, so you can see exactly what Node.js and Express are capable of.
## Instructions
This repository has branches for each of the videos in the course. You can use the branch pop up menu in github to switch to a specific branch and take a look at the course at that stage. Or you can simply add `/tree/BRANCH_NAME` to the URL to go to the branch you want to peek at.

## Branches
The branches are structured so that they correspond to the videos in the course. So, for example if I name a branch `02_03b` then that branch corresponds to the second chapter and the third video in that chapter. The extra letter at the end of the name corresponds to the state of the branch. A `b` means that this is how the code looks at the beginning of the video, an `e` means that is how the code looked at the end of the video.

You may find additional branches that correspond to other states, so for example, you may see a `t`, which means this is a target branch. A target branch is something I use during development or updates of a course and it's for a branch that I'm working towards. For the purposes of taking a course, you may ignore any additional branches. The `master` branch usually has the state of the project as I'm working through it and the final state of the code when I finish the course.

## Installing
1. Make sure you have these installed
	- [node.js](http://nodejs.org/)
	- [git](http://git-scm.com/)
2. Clone this repository into your local machine using the terminal (mac) or Gitbash (PC) `> git clone CLONEURL`
3. CD to the folder `cd FOLDERNAME`
Run `> npm install -g nodemon` to install nodemod globally
Run `> npm install` to install the project dependencies
Run `> npm start` command to start the automation


## For Local Repository using the git bash command line tool:
1. First download the git and node package
2. Build the project (angular, node.js, django or any other)
3. Go to the project directory and initiate the git using: git init
4. Add and commit the project files to the local repository (use .gitignore to
	insert all the files that you want to be ignored by git)
	Commands: git add -A  and git commit -m "commit message"
5. See status of the git using: git status
6. Goto the bitbucket and create new repository and link to existing project
